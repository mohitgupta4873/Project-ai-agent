        STYLE:
        - Inclusive, jargon-light, outcome-focused, use nice styling, bold the headlines wherever required.
        - Bullet points where it helps readability.
        - Avoid bias or age/college prestige signals; focus on skills/impact.
        - Keep it strictly {settings.MAX_JD_LENGTH} characters.
        - Don't be too monotonic and machinic in tone, be a little quirky, don't make such rigid and structured JD, instead make something eye-catching and worth attention

        NO PLACEHOLDERS WHATSOEVER:
        - The JD shouldn't have any unknown piece of information, assume anything that you find missing
